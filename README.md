## Overview 🛠️
The DPLBackend project is designed to provide a scalable and efficient backend solution that can handle various functionalities. It serves as a demonstration of my capabilities as a developer and my understanding of backend technologies.

### Project Structure
The project is organized into several key components:
- **Controllers**: Manage incoming requests and send responses.
- **Models**: Define the structure of the data using Mongoose schemas.
- **Routes**: Define the endpoints of the API and associate them with controller methods.
- **Middleware**: Handle tasks like authentication and error management.

## Technologies Used ⚙️
- **ASP.NET 8**: JavaScript runtime for building scalable network applications.


## Features ✨
- **User Authentication**: Secure login and registration using JWT, allowing users to create accounts and authenticate securely.
- **RESTful API**: Full CRUD operations for managing resources, enabling clients to interact with the backend effectively.
- **Data Validation**: Ensured input data integrity with Mongoose schemas, validating incoming requests before processing them.
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error management for a seamless user experience, returning clear error messages when issues arise.

## Installation 🛠️
